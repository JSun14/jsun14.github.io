### Things I do here
* I'm a member of [Cornell Data Science](https://cornelldata.science) - Former lead and onboarding chair.
* I used to be a (Head) TA for CS 4780: Intro to ML and Consultant for CS 3110
* Love to participate in intramural sports. I've done basketball, volleyball (reached semi-finals SP22), flag-football, and soccer. 
* Also love to take PE classes: Fencing, Badminton, Basketball, Volleyball, Golf

### A Smattering of Thoughts
* Don't go to class
    * Depends on the kind of learner: if you're like me, you're falling asleep under most professors and you study pretty well on your own time. I can never follow along as well during in class conversations so it's better to use that time elsewhere either doing almost anything else. This lets you reclaim time in my opinion since most people will need to review the material after class anyways. 
* Blacklisted Restaurants in Ctown
    * Oishii Bowl
    * Dos Amigos
    * Loumies
    * Subway (for so many reasons)
