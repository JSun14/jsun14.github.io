* I used to be a (Head) TA for CS 4780: Intro to ML

### A Smattering of Thoughts Until I Figure Out What I Want on This Page
* Don't go to class
    * Depends on the kind of learner: if you're like me, you're falling asleep under most professors and you study pretty well on your own time. I can never follow along as well during in class conversations so it's better to use that time elsewhere either doing almost anything else. This lets you reclaim time in my opinion since most people will need to review the material after class anyways. 
* Blacklisted Restaurants in Ctown
    * Oishii Bowl
    * Dos Amigos
    * Loomies
    * Subway (for so many reasons)
