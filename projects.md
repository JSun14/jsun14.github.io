### Senior Year
* Currently creating a new student taught class centered around many things production for ML Systems. This includes deployment, data drifts, online & active learning, continual training, MLOps tooling and frameworks, etc.
    This is advised/sponsored by Professor Christopher De Sa and Munich RE.

### Junior Year
* Won first in ProjectX, a competition hosted by UofT, in the epidemiology category with a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01483) published to the corresponding 
    conference.
* Contributed to [CoalescenceML](https://github.com/bayoumi17m/CoalescenceML), an [open-source](https://pypi.org/project/coalescenceml/#description) MLOps framework to develop industry-grade production ML pipelines coalescing the MLOps stack under one umbrella.
* Led some initiatives on Cornell Data Science:
    * Pushed for all projects to be pitched team-wide rather than keeping internal subteam projects. This allowed for collaboration and more ambitious projects to be undertaken. 
    * As onboarding chair, I created the first iteration of a centralized onboarding campaign for the entire team, consisting of weekly lectures and culminating in a datathon. This improved 
      team culture as well as technical proficiency amongst new members.
    * Had the education team begin recruiting with other subteams to increase team size by threefold.
    * Revised and pushed for the creation of a [tutorials/blog site](https://cornelldatascience.github.io/education-blogs/)

### Sophomore Year
* Placed 4th in kaggle [competition](https://github.com/ptwu/election-county-prediction) amongst a class size of ~400 for CS 4780 - Intro to ML
* Built the beginnings of a basketball sports betting system with some basic benchmark models [here](https://github.com/Silver-Scripters/scraper).
* Lectured for the student run Intro to Data Science class - INFO 1998.  

### Freshman Year
* Won a hackathon (Cornell Hospitality Hackathon sponsored by Hilton)
    *  The solution consisted of a guest room assignment clustering algorithm in addition to additional
        features on the Hilton Rewards App to better optimize room turnovers. This would have the benefits of
        allowing guests to check-in earlier if they arrive before the hotel's universal check-in time (potentially
        even removing it). This also alleviates a lot of the physical ailments that cleaning staff often suffer
        due to the incredibly fast turnover pace. 
* 2nd Place in the Cornell Mathematical Competition for Modeling
    * Our paper can be found [here](/assets/documents/CMCM.pdf)
    * We were also able to participate in the international version of the competition as a result and this was our corresponding [paper](/assets/documents/MCM.pdf)
* Won a class competition for ENGRD 2720 - Intro to Data Science for Engineers. 
    * The winning [visualization](/assets/img/Visual.pdf)
* Recreated the Wii Play Tanks [game](https://github.com/JSun14/final3110) in OCaml for our final project for CS 3110. 
* Built the frontend for an [online office hours](https://github.com/bayoumi17m/oh-online) system over spring break during Covid for classes to use upon resumption.
